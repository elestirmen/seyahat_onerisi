2. **Balanced Experience**
   - Mix different types of POIs (historical, natural, cultural)
   - Consider visitor fatigue and rest points
   - Include facilities like restrooms, cafes, or parking when relevant

3. **Time Management**
   - Set realistic time estimates for each POI
   - Consider photography time, reading information, etc.
   - Account for travel time between POIs in total duration

## Best Practices

### Route Creation Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**
   - Use descriptive, clear names
   - Include location and route type

   - Level 3: Moderate, requires basic fitness
   - Level 4: Hard, requires good fitness and experience
   - Level 5: Very hard, for experienced and fit individuals only

4. **Duration Estimation**

   - Add buffer time for photos, rest, and unexpected delays
   - Consider the target audience's pace

5. **Seasonal Considerations**

   - Consider weather conditions, daylight hours
   - Note seasonal attractions or closures

### Quality Assurance

   - Remove or modify routes if conditions change
