# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The POI API system is currently failing to connect to PostgreSQL because the database schema is missing required columns, specifically the "category" column. The system falls back to JSON mode, which limits functionality. This feature will implement a proper database migration system to ensure the PostgreSQL schema matches the application's expectations and provide tools to migrate existing data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database schema to be automatically validated and migrated when the application starts, so that the POI API can function properly with PostgreSQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check if the required database schema exists
2. WHEN the schema is missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL automatically create the required tables and columns
3. WHEN the migration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log the migration status
4. WHEN the migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a database migration script that can be run independently, so that I can set up the database schema without starting the full application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the migration script THEN it SHALL create all required tables if they don't exist
2. WHEN I run the migration script on an existing database THEN it SHALL only add missing columns and tables
3. WHEN the migration script encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide detailed error messages
4. WHEN the migration completes THEN it SHALL provide a summary of changes made

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing JSON data to the PostgreSQL database, so that I don't lose existing POI data when switching from JSON fallback mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON data exists and the database is empty THEN the system SHALL offer to import JSON data
2. WHEN importing JSON data THEN the system SHALL validate each POI record before insertion
3. WHEN importing JSON data THEN the system SHALL handle coordinate conversion properly
4. WHEN import fails for specific records THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue with remaining records

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to support all current POI features including ratings, media, and location data, so that no functionality is lost during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the schema THEN it SHALL include all required columns for POI data
2. WHEN creating the schema THEN it SHALL include proper indexes for performance
3. WHEN creating the schema THEN it SHALL include the ratings table for the new rating system
4. WHEN creating the schema THEN it SHALL use PostGIS for location data storage
